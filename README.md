# Wordle

This is a wordle clone built with React, created as a practice exercise. You can find the practice instructions at https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/wordle

### Requirements

Be familiar with the rules of Wordle. You can read the rules on Wikipedia and try out the game for yourself on New York Times.

### Instructions

For practice sake, we'll implement Wordle with the following differences:

Wordle has a global word of the day and can only be played once per day which complicates development. For our Wordle, a random word is chosen every time the app launches. Some five-letter words are provided to you in the skeleton.
No need to validate if a guess is a valid 5-letter word.
Add a "Reset" button that's displayed after the game ends so that the user can play again with another randomly-chosen word.
Wordle's colors should you choose to use them:
